**No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it.**

**-- Albert Einstein**

Area 51 Machine Design is a group of experienced professionals that share a passion for the creation of superior machinery design.  Offering services and custom products to owners and operators of industrial machinery, both in the oil patch and in the rapidly growing manufacturing sector of western Canada.  Area 51 provides cost-effective high quality redesign of troublesome machinery and also new and innovative design when appropriate. 

A unique component of Area 51's work philosophy is that the designers and engineers that work on a particular project are also responsible for prototyping, machining, and assembling the working prototypes. This cross over allows for seamless integration between the shop floor and the design floor. Designers which have a hands on working familiarity with the components are able to create machinery and components which are easy to manufacture, assemble, and operate.
